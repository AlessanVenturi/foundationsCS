We will work on the sample database *snldb*, where each row corresponds to sketch of a TV show.

1.    read the data in database/snldb/db/snl_title.csv
2.     remove all rows that do not have a title
3.     Build a DataFrame with index the pair (season id, episode id).
3.     Extract the sketches of seasons 3 and 4.
